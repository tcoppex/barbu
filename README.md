Barb端 is a prototyping framework for real-time 3D graphics aimed at simulating hairy creatures.

It is written in **C++ 17** and **OpenGL 4.6 (Core Profile)**.

Check the gallery [here](https://imgur.com/a/MgJyFNG), or take a [sneak peek](https://imgur.com/ZyjYbiN).

## Some Features

* Entity-Components based system with live scene edit.
* Hot-reload of external assets (*textures, models, shaders*).
* PBR pipeline with Image Based Lighting.
* Postprocessing with tonemapping and horizontal based SSAO.
* Marschner's hair reflectance model GPU implementation.
* Dynamic GPU particles & hair simulation.
* GPU skinning animation via Dual Quaternion blending.
* GLTF 2.0 & OBJ drag-n-drop model import.
* Features rich camera controls.
* Colourful console logger with context tracking !

## Quickstart

We will use the command-line on Unix and [Git Bash](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) on Windows.

### Cloning the repo.

First be sure to have [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) installed on your system to retrieve the assets, then clone the repo with its submodules :

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/tcoppex/barbu.git
```

The following third parties are used :

* [GLFW (3.3.4)](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/tree/3.3.4) : window management,
* [GLM (0.9.9.8)](https://github.com/g-truc/glm/releases/tag/0.9.9.8) : linear algebra.
* [imgui (1.82)](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/v1.82) : user interface.
* [im3d (1.16)](https://github.com/john-chapman/im3d/) : gizmo controller.
* [stb_image (2.26)](https://github.com/nothings/stb) : image loader.
* [cgltf (1.10)](https://github.com/jkuhlmann/cgltf) : gltf 2.0 loader.
* [MikkTSpace](https://github.com/mmikk/MikkTSpace) : tangent space computation.

Some are shipped directly while others are retrieved as submodules. If you
need to retrieved them separately, use this command in the project directory :
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Build

We will first create a build directory then generate the CMake cache depending on your system.

```bash
mkdir BUILDs && cd BUILDs
```

On **Unix**, using Makefile :
```bash
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build . -- -j `nproc`
```

On **Windows**, using MSVC 15 for x64:
```bash
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64"
cmake --build . --target ALL_BUILD --config Release
```

*Notes : Using CMake, the build configuration type (ie. Debug, Release) is set at Build Time with MSVC and at Cache Generation Time with Makefile.*

#### CMake Options

 1. When using a HDPI screen, you can specify the UI scaling with via `OPT_HDPI_SCALING` (eg. `-DOPT_HDPI_SCALING=1.5`).
 2. OpenGL extensions are generated automatically by a custom [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) script.  Alternatively [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) can be used by specifying the option `-DOPT_USE_GLEW=ON` to CMake. __If something does not compile due to OpenGL functions, try to use GLEW instead.__
 3. By default some third parties are compiled as shared libraries. You can switch them to static by using the option `-DOPT_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF`.

### Run

The binary can be found in the project `./bin/` directory:
```bash
../bin/barbu
```

### Known issues

This project will not run on integrated GPUs with a "Compatibility Profile"-only driver.
